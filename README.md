4. Follow the instructions in <a href="https://github.com/mortenjust/tensorswift-ios">mortenjust/tensorswift-ios</a> and keep the script running the entire time that you're running <a href="https://github.com/mortenjust/trainer-mac">mortenjust/trainer-mac</a>

* For this to work, the folder `tf_files`, which is generated by running the <a href="https://github.com/mortenjust/trainer-mac">trainer-mac</a> program, must be in your Mac's Home directory. If this isn't possible, open fix.sh and edit the line `FILE="$HOME/tf_files/projects/tensorswift-ios/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/eigen/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/src/Tensor/TensorStorage.h"` so that FILE equals the path of the `tf_files` folder.
