# Tensorswift iOS script
A script you can run on MacOS to make <a href="https://github.com/mortenjust/tensorswift-ios">mortenjust/tensorswift-ios</a> work with Xcode Version 10.0. Run this script the whole time you are running <a href="https://github.com/mortenjust/trainer-mac">mortenjust/trainer-mac</a> to make the program work. 

**This only works for MacOS**

## Instructions 

1. Clone or download this repo to get the file fix.sh (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/">how to clone a github repo</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6466945/fastest-way-to-download-a-github-project"> how to download a github repo</a>) 
2. Open terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded fix.sh. Alternatively you can type `cd` into the terminal and then drop and drag the folder that contains fix.sh into the terminal and press `enter`. For example if fix.sh is on your Desktop:

4. Follow the instructions in <a href="https://github.com/mortenjust/tensorswift-ios">mortenjust/tensorswift-ios</a> and keep the script running the entire time that you're running <a href="https://github.com/mortenjust/trainer-mac">mortenjust/trainer-mac</a>

* For this to work, the folder `tf_files`, which is generated by running the <a href="https://github.com/mortenjust/trainer-mac">trainer-mac</a> program, must be in your Mac's Home directory. If this isn't possible, open fix.sh and edit the line `FILE="$HOME/tf_files/projects/tensorswift-ios/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/eigen/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/src/Tensor/TensorStorage.h"` so that FILE equals the path of the `tf_files` folder.
